      <description>After a year-end trip with a bunch of my closest friends from Purdue, we all decided to link to eachothers sites to put our network out on the web.
 Jacob Zietek: Human-Robot Interaction, Machine Learning, and the person I have to thank for my interest in ML &amp;amp; introducing me to this network of now close friends Cole Roberts: OS/Embedded Dev, Stoic master, Fitness/Health Hobbyist Jinen Setpal: ML/AI Interpretability Researcher, Everyones Hypeman, Productivity Master Sagar Patil: Rockets, AI, Human Knowledge-Base Mikail Khan: Programming Languages Researcher Aref Malek: Software Engineer Harmya Bhatt: Software Engineer Bhavesh: Software Engineer, Web Dev  All links work as of May 2024</description>

      <description>Overview You can see Trine Universities overview of the project here: Artificial Intelligence Maritime Manuever Intercollegiate Challenge. This project, as the name states, is a competition between Purdue Main Campus, Purdue Fort Wayne, Indiana University, Trine University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and Notre Dame. Every team got a completely hollowed out 12ft wooden boat along with a grant to transform the boat into an autonomous agent that could navigate an obstacle course.</description>

      <description>Overview VEX Robotics is a yearly world-wide competition on levels ranging from middle school to college. VEX introduced an AI competition in 2021, so I joined Purdue&amp;rsquo;s newely formed VEXAI team as a member of the reinforcement learning subteam. The competition never happened due to supply chain issues, nonetheless our team was able to build an autonomous robot that could navigate through the playing field and pick up rings (the games objective).</description>
