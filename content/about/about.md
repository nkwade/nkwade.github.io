## Post-Grad Robotics Intern @ [Persona AI](https://personainc.ai/) 
Houston, TX | May 25 - Aug 25

Grateful to join an early stage (pre-seed ~30 people) startup working on building humanoid robots for heavy industries. So far my focus has been on integrating hardware through SDKs into the teleoperation & manipulation stack along with hardware abstraction to speed up development timelines for ML infrastructure. I plan on working on locomotion via RL and whole-body teleoperation. Please reach me at nicholas@wade.dev if you are interested in joining or just want to talk about robotics!
